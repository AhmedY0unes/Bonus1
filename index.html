                </h3>
               <p> In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the term cup cake or cupcake. 
                In previous centuries,<br> before muffin tins were widely available, 
                the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, or molds and took their name<br> from the cups they 
                were baked in. 
                This is the use of the name that has remained,and the name of "cupcake" is now given<br> to any small,
                  round cake that is about the size of a teacup. 
                 While English fairy cakes vary in size more than American <br>cupcake, 
                 they are traditionally smaller and are rarely toppedwith elaborate icing.</p>
